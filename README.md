ElectroSpray Design

1. Helium mode: It replaces most of the N2 and CO2 gases by He gas. This is used in the publication "Helium-electrospray improves sample delivery in X-ray single-particle imaging experiments" [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54605-9].
2. Multi_Cones: It is used to generate multiple cones in the ES setup. This is used in the publication "Enhancing electrospray ionization efficiency for particle transmission through an aerodynamic lens stack" [https://journals.iucr.org/s/issues/2024/02/00/gy5055/index.html].
3. Coaxial ES: It is used to generate coaxial electrospray. This is used in the publication "Coaxial Helium Electrospray: Widening the Spectrum of Supported Samples for Single-Particle Imaging at XFELs"
